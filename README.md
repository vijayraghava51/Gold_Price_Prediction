# 💹 Gold Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the future prices of gold using various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (ANN) techniques. It was developed as part of a **1-month AI & ML internship** by a team of two members.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze historical gold price data
- Apply regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
- Visualize gold price trends and predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (optional)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
